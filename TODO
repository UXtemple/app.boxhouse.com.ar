* replace types for panel.js that includes the panel itself and all of its dependencies. It will
  only export one component which holds the panel itself
* injectActions instead of using them with flux
* define store handlers as raw functions and pass in the state
* remove action classes https://github.com/acdlite/flummox/issues/223
* PanelsFluxComponent -> FluxComponent w/panels prop on children?
* real URIs on hrefs - it doesn't matter that internally we do something else, a user should be
  able to open them in another window too.
* lists into list component
* panels-server + file structure for serving apps
* fetching remote stuff from panels-server
* a backend for apps like a DB for BH in a way
* users / authentication
* centred panels
* app config (bg colour, etc.)
* animations on panels
* session store
* de/rehydrate stores in a more common way
